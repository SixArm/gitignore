##
# Dot paths
#
# Reject dot paths a.k.a. hidden paths by default,
# then override in order to accept specific paths.
#
# First reject dot paths, which are conventionally intended
# to be hidden, or local only, or unversioned data, such as
#
#     .foo
#     .foo-bar
#     .foo_bar
#
# Then accept git-specific files that are conventionally versioned:
#
#     .gitignore
#
# Then accept dot paths that are considered example paths.
# These paths are for placeholders, samples, etc., such as:
#
#     .foo.example
#     .foo-example
#     .foo_example
#
# Then accept dot paths that are considered encryped paths.
# These paths are for GPG files, PGP files, etc., such as:
#
#     foo.gpg
#     foo.pgp
