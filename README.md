# gitignore file and test suite

A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
Files already tracked by Git are not affected; see the NOTES below for details.

Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to
ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns from multiple sources,
with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest (within one level
of precedence, the last matching pattern decides the outcome):

This repository has our gitgnore file and testing for it.

We welcome constructive feedback, suggestions, questions, etc.
